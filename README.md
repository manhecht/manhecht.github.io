   - Check "Enforce HTTPS" (recommended)
   - Save the settings

2. **In your phpfriends DNS settings:**
   - Log in to your phpfriends control panel
   - Navigate to the DNS management section for manuelhecht.com
   - Add the following DNS records:
     
     **Option 1: Apex domain (manuelhecht.com)**
     Add these A records pointing to GitHub Pages' IP addresses:
     ```
     A    @    185.199.108.153
     A    @    185.199.109.153

   - You can check propagation using tools like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)

4. **Verify your domain:**
