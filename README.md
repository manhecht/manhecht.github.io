### GitHub Pages Deployment for manhecht.github.io

Since your GitHub username is "manhecht", you can host this site at manhecht.github.io by following these steps:

#### Option 1: User Site (manhecht.github.io)

1. Create a GitHub repository named exactly `manhecht.github.io`
2. Push this repository to GitHub:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/manhecht/manhecht.github.io.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. GitHub Pages is automatically enabled for repositories named `username.github.io`
4. Your site will be published at `https://manhecht.github.io/`

#### Option 2: Project Site (any repository name)

1. Create a GitHub repository with any name (e.g., `portfolio`)
2. Push this repository to GitHub:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/manhecht/portfolio.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Go to your repository on GitHub
4. Navigate to Settings > Pages
5. Under "Source", select "main" branch
6. Click Save
7. Your site will be published at `https://manhecht.github.io/portfolio/`

### Automatic Deployment to phpfriends Webserver

This repository is configured to automatically deploy to your phpfriends webserver whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. This is done using GitHub Actions and FTP deployment.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Configure GitHub Repository Secrets:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `FTP_SERVER`: Your phpfriends FTP server address (e.g., `ftp.phpfriends.at`)
     - `FTP_USERNAME`: Your phpfriends FTP username
     - `FTP_PASSWORD`: Your phpfriends FTP password

2. **How It Works:**
   - When you push changes to the main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically:
     - Checkout your repository
     - Upload all files to your phpfriends webserver via FTP
     - Exclude unnecessary files like .git directories and node_modules

3. **Deployment Status:**
   - You can check the status of deployments in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository
   - Each deployment will show logs and any errors that occurred

4. **Customizing Deployment:**
   - The deployment configuration is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - You can modify this file to change deployment settings, such as:
     - Which files to exclude from deployment
     - Which directory on the server to deploy to
     - Additional steps before or after deployment

This setup ensures that your website at manuelhecht.com is always up-to-date with the latest changes in your repository.
